# Bryson's Synth 1 Presets!
hey pals! Synth1 is a super sweet tiny little piece of software that's totally free, and it's been my go to plugin for audio synthesis for over 10 years now! I never made an effort to build my own preset packs, but I'm having a ton of fun with it lately and I hope these little presets might inspire you to play around with the plugin and make some sounds : )

# Usage:

clone the repo to any directory you like, then from your DAW of choice (as long as it can load the Synth1 dll), select "opt" in the synth1 gui, then assign the file path to "Bryson-Synth1" on one of your internal soundbanks! I'll be updating this repo as i make more sounds, so check in every now and then for new commits to pull! eventually i'll package a release in a zip file for more secure distribution, but for now this is mostly for me to be able to sync these presets between my various music making machines.

if you want to download the repo as a zip from the <>Code button above, you should be able to drop the zip in your (on windows) ProgramFiles/VSTPlugins/Synth1/ZipBank folder and load the bank externally, though I have not tested this for loading, let me know if that won't work!
